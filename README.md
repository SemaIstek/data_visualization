# Climate-Related Economic Losses Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the economic consequences of climate change in developed countries, with a focus on Europe. By leveraging publicly available data and utilizing data analysis techniques in Python, the goal is to provide insights into the magnitude and nature of climate-related economic losses over the past decade.

## Key Features
- Data collection from the Eurostat API
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Calculation of climate-related economic losses
- Visualization of findings using matplotlib and seaborn
- Generation of insights and implications

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- requests
- matplotlib
- seaborn
